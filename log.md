# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 6th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I have started going through the front end tutorial on free code camp

**Thoughts** I found out about this challenge via a Medium article this morning, and I am intrigued! Also, I am learning a good amount of how to use GitHub for the first time.

**Link(s) to work:**

  1. Link a photo with a dead hyperlink https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/turn-an-image-into-a-link 
  2. Use spans for inline elements https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-spans-for-inline-elements

### Day 2: December 8th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: After going through 69 lessons yesterday, I worked through another 26 today.

**Thoughts** I ran into a few issues working with Bootstrap, as well as jQuery.  This is the first time I am working with either of the languages hands on, so I'm looking forward to digging in a little deeper with both of them.

**Link(s) to work:**

  1. Target HTML Elements with Selectors using jQuery https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/target-html-elements-with-selectors-using-jquery 

### Day 3: December 9th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Was only able to get about 30 minutes done today, got super busy with work, and car issues.

**Thoughts** Still working within jQuery on freeCodeCamp, really enjoying how it works, and how much you can actually manipulate within the entire framework of your project.

**Link(s) to work:**

1. nothing to really share today.

### Day 4: December 10th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all of the jQuery tutorials on freeCodeCamp, and started up on my tribute project.

**Thoughts** This is a lot harder than expected and will need to continue to research on how to do everything, and maybe even start from lesson 1 again so that I can kind of drill everything down a little bit further.
