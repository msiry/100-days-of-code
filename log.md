# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 6th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I have started going through the front end tutorial on free code camp

**Thoughts** I found out about this challenge via a Medium article this morning, and I am intrigued! Also, I am learning a good amount of how to use GitHub for the first time.

**Link(s) to work:**

  2. Use spans for inline elements https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-spans-for-inline-elements

### Day 2: December 8th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: After going through 69 lessons yesterday, I worked through another 26 today.

**Thoughts** I ran into a few issues working with Bootstrap, as well as jQuery.  This is the first time I am working with either of the languages hands on, so I'm looking forward to digging in a little deeper with both of them.

### Day 3: December 9th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Was only able to get about 30 minutes done today, got super busy with work, and car issues.

**Thoughts** Still working within jQuery on freeCodeCamp, really enjoying how it works, and how much you can actually manipulate within the entire framework of your project.

1. nothing to really share today.

### Day 4: December 10th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all of the jQuery tutorials on freeCodeCamp, and started up on my tribute project.

**Thoughts** This is a lot harder than expected and will need to continue to research on how to do everything, and maybe even start from lesson 1 again so that I can kind of drill everything down a little bit further.

  1. Use jQuery to Modify the Entire Page https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-jquery-to-modify-the-entire-page
  
  ### Day 5: December 11th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out who I want to do a tribute page for, Sun Tzu, so I banged out 95% of that.

**Thoughts** I did a lot of trial and error with the page.  Looked at a lot of bootstrap code from the BS site itself, ran into a few issues working with Descriptive links, so that I wound up just going with an unstyled list.

**Link(s) to work:**

1. none today

  ### Day 6: December 12th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up my Tribute Page project, started on Odin Project lessons. 

**Thoughts** So I finished up my tribute page this morning, however, I went to go look at the next challenge on FCC, and realized that I am in no way ready to tackle that project just yet.  I am a bit overwhelmed by everything that I need to include in the project, so I am going to start work on the odin project site, and go through all of the web fundamentals to give me a better understanding of what I need to do.  Odin Project is extremely intensive, and I am genuinely excited to start working in the applications.  Got up to the cmd line basics portion of the lesson.
