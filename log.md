# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 6th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I have started going through the front end tutorial on free code camp

**Thoughts** I found out about this challenge via a Medium article this morning, and I am intrigued! Also, I am learning a good amount of how to use GitHub for the first time.

**Link(s) to work:**
