# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 16th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Did some work on a Mimo Blog, and started my 2018 web developer course on Udemy

**Thoughts** Started the challenge over today, even though I have been trying to stay on top of doing my hour a day, the day's have been inconsistent, and I have been playing catch-up.
Making a new dedication to doing the 100 days of code for at least an hour every single day.

**Link(s) to work:**

  1. No links to my work, but I have a few local files now with a blog I am creating from Mimo.  As well as the first website with Udemy.

### Day 2: Janary 17th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the 2018 Udemy course. Worked on my own HTML only page, and submitted it to the slack channel.  Also, Started a new project based in CSS, including learning a bunch of selectors, as well as the order of how the CSS is ran.

**Thoughts** Had an issue with adding my background image, first locally, than adding a URL, neither of them would display the image.  I finally got the local image to save, as I was typing the incorrect filepath, as it the image was nested in the Images folder.

  1. No links today, however, I am hoping to have something to upload in the next few days.
