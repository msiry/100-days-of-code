# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 16th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Did some work on a Mimo Blog, and started my 2018 web developer course on Udemy

**Thoughts** Started the challenge over today, even though I have been trying to stay on top of doing my hour a day, the day's have been inconsistent, and I have been playing catch-up.
Making a new dedication to doing the 100 days of code for at least an hour every single day.

  1. No links to my work, but I have a few local files now with a blog I am creating from Mimo.  As well as the first website with Udemy.
